I am Eulan Angelika R. Manginsay. I'm 19 years old, and am turning a year older next week, November 14. I'm the youngest among two siblings. I usually watch films or series during my free time. I enjoy listening to Kpop :))))) my favorite groups are exo and seventeen! (stan seventeen). I'm quite a picky eater, though I really have a sweet tooth and would definitely eat all kinds of fruit there are. I enjoy my solitude and peace.
